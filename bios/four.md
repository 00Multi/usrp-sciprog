Ryan Golant grew up in Falls Church, VA--around 20 minutes outside of DC--having lived in Northern Virginia his entire life. Ryan came to Princeton in the class of 2020 expecting to major in some STEM field, initially either physics or math. After studying a bit of astrophysics on his own, and taking AST 204 in his first year, Ryan developed a great interest in astro, and now intends to major in the subject. Ryan looks forward to studying weak gravitational lensing and dark energy with Jia Liu this summer.
