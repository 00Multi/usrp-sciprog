Carlos Anicetti is a rising junior and an Astrophysics major. He is from San Francisco, California. He has been interested in space for his entire life, and decided to become an astrophysicist after working at a small observatory during his time in high school (he is still employed there). He finds all of astrophysics extremely cool, but is particularly interested in exoplanets and quasars.
