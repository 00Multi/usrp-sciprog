--------------------------------

Timothy Morton grew up in Columbus, OH, went to undergrad at Harvard, 
received his [PhD](http://thesis.library.caltech.edu/8024/) from Caltech, and moved to Princeton in 2013. His
research focus is on the demographics of exoplanet systems, and he has done a
lot of work in particular regarding [distinguishing true planets from astrophysical false positives](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/science/kepler-planets-nasa.html?_r=0) for the Kepler
mission.  This is his third year helping to organize the URSP.  His [wife](http://www.sns.ias.edu/~verag/) is a
cosmologist at the [Institute for Advanced Study](https://www.ias.edu/), and they have a 3 year-old son
named [Andrej](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAIhtf77jD0).  Outside astronomy, data science, and family, his interests
include playing piano, choral music, and sports involving running, balls, or
flying discs.

Peter Melchior got his PhD from Heidelberg University (Germany) in 2010, was a
CCAPP Fellow at the Ohio State University from 2011 - 2015, and came to
Princeton in the fall of 2015.
His research interests are in observational cosmology, particularly the
high-precision measurements necessary for weak gravitational lensing.
He has been or is working on various surveys: CLASH (a large Hubble Space
Telescope program), DES, LSST, J-PAS, and WFIRST.
Outside work, he enjoys practicing Aikido, skiing, wind surfing, music and the
