Team bio for the URSP organizers
--------------------------------

Andy Goulding received his [PhD](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010PhDT.......223G) from Durham
University (UK) in 2010. He was a Smithsonian Postdoctoral Fellow at
the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics from 2010-2014, and
came to Princeton in the fall of 2014. His research focuses on the
demographics of active galactic nuclei, and observations of the
co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. This
is his 2nd year helping with the USRP. His outside interests include
competitive running and triathlons, skiing, diving and cinema.

Peter Melchior got his [PhD](http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/10954/) from Heidelberg University (Germany) in 2010, was a [CCAPP Fellow](http://ccapp.osu.edu) at the Ohio State University from 2011 - 2015, and came to Princeton in the fall of 2015.
His research interests are in observational cosmology, particularly the high-precision measurements necessary for [weak gravitational lensing](http://pmelchior.net/research_des_sv_clusters.html), and astrostatistics.
He has been or is working on various surveys: [DES](http://www.darkenergysurvey.org/), [LSST](http://lsst.org/), and [WFIRST](http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/).
Outside work, he enjoys practicing Aikido, skiing, wind surfing, music and the
arts.

Timothy Morton grew up in Columbus, OH and received his [PhD](http://thesis.library.caltech.edu/8024/) from Caltech in 2013, after which he moved to Princeton. His research focus is on understanding the demographics of exoplanet systems, and he has done a
lot of work in particular regarding [distinguishing true planets from astrophysical false positives](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/science/kepler-planets-nasa.html?_r=0) for the Kepler
mission.  This is his fourth year helping to organize the URSP.  His [wife](http://www.sns.ias.edu/~verag/) is a
cosmologist at the [Institute for Advanced Study](https://www.ias.edu/), and they have a 4 year-old son
named [Andrej](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAIhtf77jD0) and a 5-month old daughter named Zoe.  Outside astronomy, data science, and family, his interests
include playing piano, choral music, and sports involving running, balls, or
flying discs.
