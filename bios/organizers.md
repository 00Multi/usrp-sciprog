Team bio for the URSP organizers
--------------------------------

Timothy Morton grew up in Columbus, OH and  
received his [PhD](http://thesis.library.caltech.edu/8024/) from Caltech in 2013, after which he moved to Princeton. His
research focus is on understanding the demographics of exoplanet systems, and he has done a
lot of work in particular regarding [distinguishing true planets from astrophysical false positives](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/05/11/science/kepler-planets-nasa.html?_r=0) for the Kepler
mission.  This is his third year helping to organize the URSP.  His [wife](http://www.sns.ias.edu/~verag/) is a
cosmologist at the [Institute for Advanced Study](https://www.ias.edu/), and they have a 3 year-old son
named [Andrej](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAIhtf77jD0).  Outside astronomy, data science, and family, his interests
include playing piano, choral music, and sports involving running, balls, or
flying discs.

Peter Melchior got his [PhD](http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/10954/) from Heidelberg University (Germany) in 2010, was a [CCAPP Fellow](http://ccapp.osu.edu) at the Ohio State University from 2011 - 2015, and came to Princeton in the fall of 2015.
His research interests are in observational cosmology, particularly the high-precision measurements necessary for [weak gravitational lensing](http://pmelchior.net/research_des_sv_clusters.html), and the filamentary cosmic web.
He has been or is working on various surveys: [CLASH](http://www.stsci.edu/~postman/CLASH/Home.html), [DES](http://www.darkenergysurvey.org/), [LSST](http://lsst.org/), [J-PAS](http://www.j-pas.org/), and [WFIRST](http://wfirst.gsfc.nasa.gov/).
Outside work, he enjoys practicing Aikido, skiing, wind surfing, music and the
arts.

Andy Goulding received his [PhD]
(http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2010PhDT.......223G) from Durham
University (UK) in 2010. He was a Smithsonian Postdoctoral Fellow at
the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics from 2010-2014, and
came to Princeton in the fall of 2014. His research focuses on the
demographics of active galactic nuclei, and observations of the
co-evolution of supermassive black holes and their host galaxies. This
is his 2nd year helping with the USRP. His outside interests include
competitive running and triathlons, skiing, diving and cinema.

Nick Battaglia received his PhD
(http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011PhDT.......270B) from the
University of Toronto (Canada) in 2011. He was a McWilliams
Postdoctoral fellow at Carnegie Mellon University from 2011-2014, and
arrived in Princeton fall 2014. His research interests include
cosmology, large-scale structure, numerical simulations, and
reionization. He is a member of several observational cosmology
experiments including the Atacama Cosmology Telescope, the Hyper
Suprime Camera, and LSST. His previous outside interests included
cooking, hiking, biking, and any sport imaginable, now they include
stacking blocks and reading "Diggers Go" with his 16 month-old son.

Elinor Medezinski received her [PhD](http://www.pha.jhu.edu/~elinor/em_pthesis_110317.pdf) from Tel-Aviv University (Israel) in 2010. She was an Assistant Research Scientist (postdoc) at the Johns Hopkins University from 2010-2014, was a Postdoctoral fellow at the Racach Institute (Jerusalem, Israel) in 2015 and came to Princeton in fall 2015. Her research interest include observational cosmology, large-scale structure (in particular clusters of galaxies) and weak gravitational lensing. She has been involved in several observational surveys - [CLASH](http://www.stsci.edu/~postman/CLASH/Home.html) and the Hyper Suprime-Cam survey [HSC](http://www.naoj.org/Projects/HSC/surveyplan.html). Outside interests include traveling, photography, cooking, sailing and (mostly) surviving her toddler's terrible twos.
