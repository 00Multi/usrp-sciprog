This is the team bio for Sinclaire and Tori:

Sinclaire

I am a sophomore at Princeton University from Northern Virginia. I hope to major in astrophysics and I have a particular interest in exoplanets. I am a member of the Princeton Highsteppers and I enjoy watching soccer and stargazing in my free time :)





Tori:

I am a rising sophomore at Princeton University from Chicago, Illinois. I am currently undeclared, but deciding between a physics and astrophysics major, seeing as my two interests currently are cosmology and biophysics. Outside of physics, I am a dancer on Bodyhype Dance company. Thus, I enjoy dancing, along with drawing, reading/writing, and playing with my dog and cat.  



This is an attempt at a merge conflict.
