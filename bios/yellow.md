Antoine Washington is a rising sophomore at Rutgers University. He studies astrophysics. His hobbies include wasting time with nonsense activities and bike riding when he's feeling unusually adventurous. Thanks for coming to my TED talJason Kim: My name is Jason and I was born in Puyallup, WA in 1998. I lived most of my life in Camas, WA. I now go to Princeton University and am in USRP.

My name is Minsu Park and I am a rising junior in the physics department here in Princeton. I will be working with Christina Kreisch on constraining neutrino self interaction parameters with cosmological data. I've lived in South Korea, California, Geneva, Cairo, and now Princeton, so it's hard to say where home is. I look forward to working with everyone this summer!
