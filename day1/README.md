Intro to Day 1
==============

“Scientific computing”: broad definition.  We all use our computers to do our research; lots of it is coding, but not all.  In order to be most productive/effective researchers, we have to use the computer well.

**FACT OF LIFE 1**: Every research project you do will involve some coding.  

Use Python as much as possible.   Unless you are doing serious numerical computational work, you should have no need for compiled languages.  Don’t use IDL if you can help it.  MatLab is nice for some things but (a) licensed/expensive, and (b) not Python.

**FACT OF LIFE 2**:  You will almost certainly have to work on multiple computers.

You probably have a laptop, some code has to run on supercomputing clusters, you have your office/department computer with access to data, etc. etc.  It’s good to know ways to do this gracefully.

**IDEAL**:  Any project you do should be 100% reproducible--- this could mean either by someone else, or by yourself in six months when you’ve forgotten everything but have to return to a project.

Another way to think of this-- portable, self-contained code. 

**NON-NEGOTIABLE**:  Use version control for everything.  Starting now.  Probably no one has made you do this before, but now is as good a time as any to start.  

Principles to keep in mind:

* Good project organization may take a little bit more time on the front end, but is 100% worth it.
* Model, model, model!  Check out other folks’ code/projects and see what works!  (Full disclosure: this is how I’ve learned pretty much everything that I know.)
