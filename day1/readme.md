##Purpose of this week

* Basic familiarity with scientific computing using python
* Basic familiarity with git/github

**FACT**: All of you have a wide variety of experience.  [Informal poll: "about how many .py files do you think you've written?"]  

Those of you with more experience, your practice this week may be more about teaching rather than learning---but as you will discover, you only really understand something if you can teach it!  

## Today's goals

* Intro to git
	* Why git?
	* What is git?
	* How to use git?
* 'Hello World!' using python (multiple ways)
* By the end of the day, everyone here should be able to do everything on [this list](todo.md).  If you have checked all these off yourself, find someone to help!
