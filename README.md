# Princeton Undergraduate Summer Research Program in Astrophysics

This repo contains information about the USRP at the Department of Astrophysical Sciences, foremost material for its first week course "Intro to Scientific Programming", aka *bootcamp*.

The plan for the first week is to give you an overview of good things to know when it comes to scientific computing, give you time to do some hands-on exercises, and provide resources for you to learn more. We aim to cover basic unix commands and remote login (ssh), software version control (git and github), the Python programming language and scientific programming stack, and basic statistics and simulations. Given that we only have a week, we will only scratch the surface on each of these topics, but many of us will be around and willing (physically or via email/Slack) to provide support and additional guidance throughout the summer.

**Before you start, please make sure that you have all requested access to the Adroit cluster following [this link](https://researchcomputing.princeton.edu/systems/adroit#access).**

For live questions of general interest to the "camp masters" and to keep in touch with your fellow campers, please subscribe to the slack channels (details sent via email, or ask your camp master/mentor) .

## Schedule of the Bootcamp

* Day 1 - unix commands, version control (github), ssh 
* Day 2 - python and numpy
* Day 3 - statistical data analysis, linear fitting, and astropy
* Day 4 - 3 options: 1- more python basics, 2- advanced data analysis, 3- running hydro simulations

All sessions take place in person in Green Hall, room 1-C-4C, located on Washington Road near Nassau Street.
**The agenda for each days is detailed in the respective README files**. 

## Colloquia and seminars

Seminars are held every Tuesday 12:30pm, colloquia every Thursday 12:30pm.
The room is Fine Hall 214. Pizza will be delivered in Grand Central at 11:45am for a quick bite before heading to the seminar location shortly after 12pm.
