# Day 3: Linear fitting and the Hubble expansion

## Schedule

* 9:30 - 10:30  Fitting a Line 1
* 11:00 - 12:30  Fitting a Line 2
* 14:00 - 14:30  `astropy` intro
* 14:30 - 15:30  Hubble 1
* 15:30 - 17:00  Hubble 2

We start with a crash course on statistical data analysis by [fitting a line to data](Fitting-a-line.ipynb), have a [brief look at `astropy`](Astropy-Demo.ipynb) for its use of physical units and coordinates, and then bring it all together by reproducing the work of Edwin Hubble and estimating the [expansion velocity of the universe](Hubble.ipynb).
