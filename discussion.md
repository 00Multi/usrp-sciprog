Student-led discussion prompts:

* Explain something you've recently learned about scientific programming (in the broad sense; maybe a Python trick, maybe a command-line tool, maybe an organizational app, etc.), and why you've found it useful.
* Give a summary of a recent [astrobites](http://astrobites.org) post or astro-ph paper you found interesting.
* Describe a recent situation where you were confused about something, and then figured it out. (odds are you won't be the only one to be confused about this same thing!)
* Describe a small feature of your everyday research routine that you just couldn't do without and that you think others might find helpful/useful.
